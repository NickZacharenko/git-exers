You packed your things in a carpetbag
Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music wherever you go

You don't fit in a small town world
But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows

You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life

You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight
